### Section 1: Computer Vision

- Lesson 4: Computer Vision Fundamentals [Link to notes](https://github.com/linyilu0323/SDCND_Notes/blob/master/L4_ComputerVisionFundamentals.md)
- **Lesson 5 (Project)**: Finding Lane Lines [@Github](https://github.com/linyilu0323/CarND_P1_LaneLines)
  - In this project, the goal is to use the basic computer vision knowledge to develop an algorithm to detect lane lines. Main techniques used in the project are: Canny detection, Hough transform.
- Lesson 6: Camera Calibration [Link to notes](https://github.com/linyilu0323/SDCND_Notes/blob/master/L6_CameraCalibration.md)
- Lesson 7: Gradients and Color Spaces [Link to notes](https://github.com/linyilu0323/SDCND_Notes/blob/master/L7_GradientsAndColorSpaces.md)
- Lesson 8: Advanced Computer Vision
- **Lesson 9 (Project)**: Advanced Lane Finding [@Github](https://github.com/linyilu0323/CarND_P2_AdvancedLaneLines)
  - This project is an advanced version of Lesson 5, it employs more advanced techniques such as: camera calibration, distortion correction, perspective transform, combined thresholding (color, gradient, in different colorspace, etc.), warping the images.

### Section 2: Deep Learning

- Lesson 10: Neural Networks [Link to notes](https://github.com/linyilu0323/SDCND_Notes/blob/master/L10_NeuralNetworks.md)
- Lesson 11: TensorFlow [Link to notes](https://github.com/linyilu0323/SDCND_Notes/blob/master/L11_TensorFlow.md)
- Lesson 12: Deep Neural Networks [Link to notes](https://github.com/linyilu0323/SDCND_Notes/blob/master/L12_DeepNeuralNetworks.md)
- Lesson 13: Convolutional Neural Networks [Link to notes](https://github.com/linyilu0323/SDCND_Notes/blob/master/L13_ConvolutionalNeuralNetworks.md)
- Lesson 14: LeNet for Traffic Signs
- **Lesson 15 (Project)**: Traffic Sign Classifier [@Github](https://github.com/linyilu0323/CarND_P3_TrafficSignClass)
  - This project uses the basic Convolutional Neural Network knowledge to build a classifier for German traffic sign. A LeNet-like architecture is built from scratch by adding TensorFlow layers one-by-one.
- Lesson 16: Keras [Link to notes](https://github.com/linyilu0323/SDCND_Notes/blob/master/L16_Keras.md)
- Lesson 17: Transfer Learning [Link to notes](https://github.com/linyilu0323/SDCND_Notes/blob/master/L17_TransferLearning.md)
- **Lesson 18 (Project)**: Behavioral Cloning [@Github](https://github.com/linyilu0323/CarND_P4_BehaviorCloning)
  - This project uses Keras sequential models and trained a neural network to "clone" driving behavior recorded from training sessions, the training inputs are images from cameras mounted on the car (simulator generated images), the output is the steering angle at each frame. Once the model is trained, we use the trained model to drive in autonomous mode.
